# Hardware reference

First generation machine:

* Raspberry Pi 4 4GB (https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-4gb.html, $55)
  4GB is more than enough for what RetroPie requires

* 2.4ghz keyboard (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756XFFJZ, $21)
  2.4ghz is faster / easier than Bluetooth and this product is slim enough
  to store anywhere

* HDMI Cable (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014I8SSD0, $8)
  With the Argon case, you can use regular HDMI cables

* Argon ONE V2 Raspberry Pi 4 Case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WP8WC3V, $25)
  Provides a good case for overclocking, IR for a tv remote, and full-size
  HDMI inputs

* 8bitdo arcade stick (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GJC5WSS, $99 each)
  The only wireless arcade stick and supports 2.4ghz

* 32GB-128GB Samsung EVO+ Micro SD Card (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XFHQGB9, $20)
  Samsung EVO+ is the most common, well-rounded SD card.  Recommend buying
  direct from Samsung to avoid fake cards.

* CanaKit 3.5A USB-C Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply (US Plug) with Noise Filter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYQRXTK, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FCMKK5X, $10)
  Provides a large amount of power to Raspberry Pi

Would have done differently:

* Argon ONE M.2 + SSD

Second generation machine:

* Intel NUC + Debian
