# Storage

## USB Drive vs. MicroSD

* The various pros don't really apply for this setup
* Everything is scripted, so transferring ROMs is easy
* Using MicroSD frees up a USB port and bus speed
* Cost is somewhat similar
* Compatibility is not an issue
* Data will be backed up and stored elsewhere
