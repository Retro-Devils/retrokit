# RetroKit

retrokit provides hands-off management of arcade systems using currently known best
practices as I understand them.

Specifically, it automatically manages:

* Argon cases
* Display
* IR
* Retroarch configuration
* Scraping
* Bezels
* Themes
* Cheats
* Launch images
* VNC

Additionally, it automates management of rom sets via ROMKit for:

* 3DO
* Arcade
* Atari2600
* C64
* GameGear
* MegaDrive
* N64
* NES
* PC
* PCEngine
* PSX
* SegaCD
* SNES

This includes complete control over filtering of Games *and* integration
with external providers to download games that you legally own.

This means you can set up your arcade machine from scratch to feature-complete
with less than a few minutes worth of work.  The automated scripts could take
days to complete depending on the size of your game collection.

This is built for RetroPie / Raspberry Pi 4.  You may customize it to your
own needs.
